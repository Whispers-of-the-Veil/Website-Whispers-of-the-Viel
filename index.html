            <p>
                Whispers of the Veil is a 2.5D pixelated horror adventure game that combines 
                atmospheric horror with cutting-edge interactive mechanics. The game integrates 
                voice commands for solving puzzles and interacting with the environment, supported 
                by adaptive AI-driven gameplay to create a unique, personalized experience. Players 
                assume the role of an older brother navigating a cursed forest to rescue his missing
                sister, encountering monsters, solving puzzles, and making impactful decisions that 
                shape the narrative. This document outlines the project’s purpose, its significance, 
                the legal and ethical aspects, any changes and progress since the initial project concept,
                the project's responsibilities, monitoring, and risks, as well as the accessibility concerns.

            <p>
                The goal of our project is to create an engaging and immersive pixel horror game that blends 
                traditional 2.5D graphics with innovative gameplay. By integrating voice recognition technology,
                players will be able to interact with the game world in ways that haven’t been seen before in
                pixel horror games. The use of voice commands will allow players to solve puzzles, communicate
                with NPCs, and confront monsters, adding a layer of immersion that makes the game feel more dynamic 
                and responsive to the player’s actions. The 2.5D graphics will provide a sense of depth, giving the 
                game a unique look that sets it apart from standard 2D pixel art games. Our target audience includes
                fans of both horror and pixel games, particularly those who are looking for something new and exciting. 
                Players who enjoy an immersive experience with interactive elements will appreciate how the game encourages 
                them to actively engage with its environment through voice. This unique approach will attract players who 
                seek more than just traditional gameplay mechanics which offers a fresh twist on the horror genre. The main 
                features of the game will focus on interaction, puzzle-solving, and combat, all driven by voice commands and 
                player choices. Players will need to speak to manipulate objects in the environment, solve puzzles, and even 
                use their voices to defeat enemies. The game’s storyline will evolve in response to the player’s actions, 
                ensuring that every playthrough feels unique. The 2.5D graphics will enhance the atmosphere, making it easy to 
                immerse oneself in the eerie, unsettling world of the game. To maintain dependability, we will focus on making 
                the game reliable and secure. This includes making sure the voice recognition system works smoothly, even in noisy 
                environments, and handling errors in a way that doesn’t disrupt the player’s experience. Data security will also 
                be important, as the game will process voice inputs, and we will take steps to protect any information provided by 
                players. By focusing on reliability and user experience, we aim to create a game that players can enjoy without 
                technical interruptions.
